#Another One Tracking Client!

Just another "Traccar manager" at present.
Traccar (www.traccar.org) is the most popular open source platform for GPS trackers.
The main idea of the app is to see the distance to objects from the observer and display all objects' tracks on the map at the same time.

You can connect the app to any Traccar server, whether it's your own or any free one, such as "www.gps-free.net".

The "Another One Tracking Client" doesn't replace the standard "Traccar manager" interface and doesn't allow you to make any admin settings.
This is a simple and lightweight open source client app for quick access to the Traccar backend.
